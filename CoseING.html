										<h3>Print Fleet Menagement</h3>
										<p>
                      All of the benefits of this solution are represented by a number of Cloud software integrated with all Computer Center dedicated printer management services. </p>
                    <p>All of these software and services dedicated to the printing world are called the Print Fleet Management (PFM) solution. This solution is a decisive help to control costs in single or dislocated environments, centralizing the responsibility for purchasing, installing, maintaining, designing, and supporting your imaging and printing resources. </p>
                    <p>The Computer Center Print Fleet Management solution helps increase staff performance and at the same time reduce total cost of ownership (TCO).
                      The Print Fleet Management project is a goal to reduce costs and accustom users to use digitized documents in various standard formats. Reducing costs is an imperative for businesses to try to deliver an effective response. </p>
                    <p>This variable adds to the degree of complexity that, with equal volumes, the costs may still vary. The processes and organization of each enterprise have a direct and different impact on every reality to be improved. The strategic superiority of cost management is perhaps difficult to accept, but it is unmistakable: there is no risk of a short-term advantage stemming from a generalized cost-cutting maneuver, compromising the competitive success of a project or enterprise over time.
