              <h3>Company-Client Interaction</h3>
              <p>In addition to collecting data and understanding what users are looking for, interviews are also a means of enhancing users, making them feel an active part of all aspects of business life and stimulating them to take an active, especially, proactive role. And that can only benefit themselves and the company they belong to.

                The information collected is then processed by Computer Center specialists in a form where the technical data on the devices and the reflections that emerged from the interviews converge in a synoptic framework. About a month later, the partner consultant returns from the customer to re-read the counters (which is indispensable for an average print volume) and to see if new requirements are emerging because the offices are dynamic and constantly evolving. Even in a relatively short period of time, which may be a month, there may be significant changes.</p><p>

              In the knowledge phase of the Computer Center user instead of setting up checklists to give to the users, we prefer to make direct interviews because only this can gather useful information, including feelings and moods of the users, which allow us to really propose The best personalized solution to meet the customer's true needs
              </p><p>
              At this point we are confronted with the internal referrer on a feasibility study aimed at drafting a project that takes into account all the factors involved, users first.
